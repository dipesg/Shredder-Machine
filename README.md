 ### **Overview**
- In any production line safety of the worker is the first priority so that they can work safely and confidently which eventually increase the growth in a company. So this project try to solve that issue by building a system which can be deployed through **IP Camera, Microcontroller, Relay etc**.
  - There are two lines in our system which makes worker cautious, one is safety line in which if workers hand reaches **ALARM Continously Set ON** and another is **Boundary Line** in which if workers hand reaches **Machine Automatically Swiched off from the command Microcontroller gives.**
- Since **Faster RCNN** give unrealistic **MAP** value so I choose to finalized my model by training it on **SSD MobileNetV2 which give me a MAP in between 60 to 70.**

### **Architechture**

### :raising_hand: Project Workflow 

Our pipeline consists of three steps:
  1. An AI model which detect all human hands in the live video at workshop.
  2. An AI model which predict if that hands is out of safety line.
  3. The output is **ALARM** to alert worker and shutting down a machine if hamd crosses **Boundary line**.
  
### ðŸš€ Model's performance
  - **Faster RCNN** give unrealistic **MAP** value of 85 so I choose to finalized my model by training it on **SSD MobileNetV2 which give me a MAP in between 70.**
  - First training with **3500** images gives the **MAP** of **60** so I increased the data to **7500. and it gives MAP of 85 in Faster RCNN and 70 on SSD MobileNetV2.**
